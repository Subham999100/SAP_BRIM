            ("Organizational Structure in MM", "The MM organizational structure consists of Client, Company Code, Plant, and Storage Location. Purchasing Organization is the organizational unit responsible for procuring materials and services. Purchasing Groups represent buyers or groups of buyers responsible for operational purchasing activities."),
            ("Master Data: Material Master (MARA/MARC)", "The Material Master is the central source of information on materials that can be procured, produced, or sold. Key database tables include MARA for general material data, MARC for plant-specific data, and MARD for storage location data. Material types include ROH (raw materials), HALB (semi-finished), and FERT (finished goods)."),
            ("Master Data: Vendor Master and BP", "In SAP ERP, vendor master data was maintained via transaction FK01/XK01. In SAP S/4HANA, the Business Partner (BP) approach is mandatory. All vendors and suppliers are created as Business Partners with specific roles such as FLVN00 (FI Vendor) and FLVN01 (Purchasing Vendor)."),
            ("Purchasing Requisition (PR)", "Purchase Requisitions are internal documents used to request the purchasing department to procure a material or service. PRs can be generated manually via transaction ME51N or automatically by MRP (Material Requirements Planning) when stock falls below reorder points."),
            ("Purchase Order Processing (ME21N)", "Purchase Orders (POs) represent legally binding requests sent to vendors to deliver goods or services at stated prices. Transaction ME21N is used to create standard POs. Key tables include EKKO for header data and EKPO for line item details. Pricing conditions determine net prices and surcharges."),
            ("Goods Receipt Process (MIGO)", "Goods Receipt (GR) records the physical receipt of goods from a vendor against a purchase order.

Invoices received from suppliers are verified against the corresponding Purchase Order and Goods Receipt. If tolerances for quantity or price are exceeded, the invoice is blocked for payment."),
            ("The 3-Way Match Verification", "The 3-Way Match is an essential financial control mechanism in SAP MM. It compares three key documents: the Purchase Order (ordered price and quantity), the Goods Receipt (delivered quantity), and the Supplier Invoice (billed price and quantity). All three must align within tolerances to approve payment."),
            ("Inventory Management Movement Types", "Movement types are three-digit numeric keys that distinguish inventory transactions. Common movement types include: 101 for Goods Receipt against PO, 102 for reversal of GR, 201 for Goods Issue to Cost Center, 261 for Goods Issue to Production Order, and 561 for initial stock upload."),

            ("Special Procurement: Subcontracting", "Subcontracting involves providing components to an external vendor who manufactures the finished product. Movement type 541 transfers components to subcontracting stock, and movement type 101 (with 543 consumption) receives the finished item."),
            ("Special Procurement: Consignment", "Vendor consignment allows vendor stock to be kept on company premises without incurring liability until consumed. Stock is held in consignment storage (movement type 411 K transfers consignment to own stock, triggering vendor liability)."),
            ("Purchasing Info Records and Source Lists", "Purchasing Info Records (ME11) link a specific vendor with a material, defining quotation prices, lead times, and tolerances. Source Lists (ME01) define preferred, allowable, or blocked sources of supply for given materials within plants."),
            ("Outline Agreements: Contracts and Scheduling", "Outline agreements include quantity/value contracts (ME31K) and scheduling agreements (ME31L). Scheduling agreements generate delivery schedules and forecast requirements directly for vendors, supporting JIT manufacturing."),
            ("Valuation Classes and Account Determination", "Valuation classes in the material master determine which general ledger accounts are updated during goods movements. Transaction OBYC configures automatic account determination using transaction keys like BSX (Inventory posting) and WRX (GR/IR clearing)."),
            ("Material Requirements Planning (MRP)", "MRP generates planned orders and purchase requisitions to satisfy dependent and independent demand. Net requirements calculations compare available warehouse stock and scheduled receipts against customer orders and planned production."),
            ("Split Valuation in SAP MM", "Split valuation allows a single material to be managed in inventory at different prices based on origin, batch, or quality. Valuation types are assigned to valuation areas, enabling accurate inventory balance sheet representation."),
            ("SAP MM Integration with Financial Accounting", "Every goods movement with financial impact automatically generates an FI document. Inventory accounts, consumption accounts, and price difference accounts (PRD) are posted real-time without batch reconciliations."),
            ("Troubleshooting and Common MM Errors", "Common MM issues include account determination errors (M8147), posting date blocked for period (M7053), and tolerance limit exceeded (M8082). Resolving these requires validating OBYC account keys, MMRV posting periods, and tolerance limits.")

It is identified by a 4-character alphanumeric code. Chart of Accounts is assigned to each company code."),
            ("General Ledger Accounting (FI-GL)", "General Ledger (FI-GL) provides a comprehensive record of all financial transactions. Every transaction posted in sub-ledgers (AR, AP, AA) updates the General Ledger real-time via reconciliation accounts. Master data is stored in tables SKA1 and SKB1."),
            ("Universal Journal Architecture (ACDOCA)", "In S/4HANA, the Universal Journal replaces traditional separate tables (BSIS, BSAS, BSIK, BSAK, COEP, FAGLFLEXA) with a single unified table: ACDOCA. ACDOCA holds both FI legal postings and CO managerial postings with up to 999,999 line items per document."),

Payments are executed using the Automatic Payment Program (F110), generating bank payment media and clearing open items."),
            ("Accounts Receivable (FI-AR) Operations", "Accounts Receivable manages customer accounting transactions. Invoices originate from SD billing documents or direct FI entries (FB70). Incoming payments (F-28) clear open receivables, and the dunning program (F150) issues reminder notices for overdue balances."),
            ("Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Overview", "Asset Accounting manages fixed assets from capitalization to retirement. Asset classes group assets with similar depreciation terms and balance sheet accounts. Depreciation runs (AFAB) post planned depreciation to general ledger accounts monthly."),
